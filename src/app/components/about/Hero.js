        I’m someone who loves to build, innovate, and turn
        ideas into reality. Whether it’s writing clean code, launching a new
        startup, or finding creative ways to solve problems, I’m always looking
        for opportunities to push boundaries and make an impact. Beyond tech and
        entrepreneurship, I’m passionate about football, ice hockey, and spending time with family, friends,
        and my dog.
